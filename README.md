# Airport PAPI Lights Detection and Quality Assessment System

## Project Overview
This project provides an automated system for detecting and evaluating PAPI (Precision Approach Path Indicator) lights quality from drone footage or aircraft approach images. The system uses computer vision techniques to identify PAPI light positions, extract RGB values, and assess the consistency and correctness of the light angles for aviation safety.

## What are PAPI Lights?
PAPI lights are visual aids located beside airport runways that help pilots maintain the correct approach angle during landing. They consist of 4 light units that display combinations of red and white lights:
- 2 red, 2 white = On correct glide path (3°)
- More red = Too low
- More white = Too high

## Project Goals
1. **Automatic PAPI Detection**: Identify PAPI light positions in images/video
2. **RGB Value Analysis**: Extract and analyze color values for each light
3. **Consistency Evaluation**: Compare RGB differences between lights
4. **Quality Assessment**: Determine if PAPI lights are correctly calibrated
5. **Report Generation**: Create detailed reports for each processed image

## Features
- Multi-PAPI detection (handles 1-2 PAPI systems per image)
- Real-time video processing capability
- RGB value extraction with precision
- Inter-light comparison metrics
- Comprehensive reporting system
- Support for various image formats (JPG, PNG, WEBP, JPEG)

## Technical Architecture

### Core Components
1. **Detection Module** (`papi_detector.py`)
   - Uses OpenCV and advanced image processing
   - Identifies bright spots and filters PAPI patterns
   - Validates geometric arrangement

2. **Analysis Module** (`rgb_analyzer.py`)
   - Extracts RGB values from detected lights
   - Calculates color differences
   - Determines red/white classification

3. **Report Generator** (`report_generator.py`)
   - Creates HTML and JSON reports
   - Includes visualizations and metrics
   - Generates comparison matrices

4. **Main Application** (`main.py`)
   - Orchestrates the detection pipeline
   - Handles batch processing
   - Manages output generation

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip package manager

### Setup
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/airport-lights-detection.git
cd airport-lights-detection

# Install required packages
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Required Libraries
- OpenCV (cv2) - Image processing and computer vision
- NumPy - Numerical computations
- Matplotlib - Visualization and plotting
- Pillow - Image I/O operations
- scikit-image - Advanced image processing algorithms

## Usage

### Basic Usage
```bash
# Process all images in the images folder
python main.py

# Process specific image
python main.py --image path/to/image.jpg

# Process with custom threshold
python main.py --threshold 200
```

### Command Line Options
- `--image`: Path to specific image file
- `--folder`: Custom folder path (default: ./images)
- `--threshold`: Brightness threshold for light detection (0-255)
- `--output`: Output directory for reports (default: ./reports)
- `--video`: Process video file instead of images

### Example Output
```
Processing: papi1.jpg
PAPI System Detected at position (450, 320)
Light 1: RGB(245, 58, 42) - RED
Light 2: RGB(248, 61, 45) - RED  
Light 3: RGB(252, 248, 245) - WHITE
Light 4: RGB(255, 251, 248) - WHITE
Status: On glide path (2 red, 2 white)
Report saved to: reports/papi1_report.html
```

## Output Report Structure

### RGB Value Matrix
Each detected PAPI system generates a matrix containing:
- Individual RGB values for each light
- Color classification (RED/WHITE)
- Inter-light RGB differences
- Consistency scores

### Difference Calculations
The system calculates differences between all light pairs:
- Light 1 vs Light 2, 3, 4
- Light 2 vs Light 3, 4
- Light 3 vs Light 4

### Quality Metrics
- **Color Purity**: How pure the red/white colors are
- **Intensity Consistency**: Brightness uniformity across lights
- **Geometric Alignment**: Horizontal alignment accuracy
- **Color Temperature**: Consistency of white lights

## Algorithm Details

### Detection Pipeline
1. **Preprocessing**
   - Convert to grayscale
   - Apply Gaussian blur for noise reduction
   - Enhance contrast using CLAHE

2. **Light Detection**
   - Threshold to find bright regions
   - Morphological operations to clean up
   - Connected component analysis

3. **PAPI Identification**
   - Group nearby bright spots
   - Validate 4-light horizontal arrangement
   - Check spacing consistency (±20% tolerance)

4. **Color Analysis**
   - Extract ROI around each light
   - Calculate mean RGB values
   - Apply color classification algorithm

5. **Validation**
   - Verify geometric constraints
   - Check color consistency
   - Validate against PAPI specifications

### Color Classification Algorithm
```python
def classify_light(r, g, b):
    if r/g > 2.0 and r/b > 2.0 and r > 200:
        return "RED"
    elif abs(r-g) < 30 and abs(g-b) < 30 and r > 200:
        return "WHITE"
    else:
        return "UNKNOWN"
```

## Performance Metrics

## Limitations
- Requires reasonable image quality (>720p recommended)
- Performance degrades in heavy fog/rain
- Optimal detection range: 0.5-5 miles from PAPI
- May struggle with extreme viewing angles (>45°)

## Future Enhancements
