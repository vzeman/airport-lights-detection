# Permission System Implementation Summary

## Completed ✅
1. ✅ Fixed users endpoint SQLAlchemy lazy loading issue
2. ✅ Added `require_airport_access()` helper function in `deps.py`
3. ✅ Added `require_session_access()` helper function in `deps.py`
4. ✅ Added null-safe GPS coordinate conversion in `frame_measurement.py`
5. ✅ Added airport access check to upload-video endpoint
6. ✅ Updated sessions endpoint to filter by user's airports
7. ✅ Added session access checks to all 11 session/* endpoints

## Implementation Complete - All Endpoints Updated

### Import Changes Needed
Add to imports at top of file:
```python
from app.core.deps import require_airport_access, require_session_access
```

### Endpoint Changes Required

#### 1. POST /upload-video (Line ~194)
**Add parameter:**
```python
_airport_check: User = Depends(lambda airport_icao=Form(...), user=Depends(get_current_user), db=Depends(get_db):
    require_airport_access(airport_icao, user, db))
```
**Purpose:** Verify user has access to airport before allowing video upload

#### 2. GET /sessions (Line ~29)
**Filter query by user's airports:**
```python
# After building base query
if not current_user.is_superuser:
    # Get list of airport ICAO codes user has access to
    airport_icao_codes = [a.icao_code for a in current_user.airports]
    query = query.filter(MeasurementSession.airport_icao_code.in_(airport_icao_codes))
    count_query = count_query.filter(MeasurementSession.airport_icao_code.in_(airport_icao_codes))
```
**Purpose:** Users only see sessions from their assigned airports

#### 3. All Session/* Endpoints (Lines 250-657)
**For each endpoint with `session_id` parameter, add:**
```python
session_check: tuple = Depends(require_session_access)
```
**Then use the returned session instead of fetching again:**
```python
_, session = session_check
# Now use 'session' instead of querying db again
```

**Endpoints to update:**
- `/session/{session_id}/preview`
- `/session/{session_id}/confirm-lights`
- `/session/{session_id}/reprocess`
- `/session/{session_id}/status`
- `/session/{session_id}/report`
- `/session/{session_id}/html-report`
- `/session/{session_id}/html-report-content`
- `/session/{session_id}/papi-video/{light_name}`
- `/session/{session_id}/enhanced-video`
- `/session/{session_id}/original-video`
- `/session/{session_id}/measurements-data`

## Benefits
1. **Security:** Users can only access data from airports they're assigned to
2. **Privacy:** Prevents data leakage between airports
3. **Compliance:** Meets multi-tenant security requirements
4. **Performance:** Sessions query filtered early, reducing unnecessary data retrieval

## Testing Checklist
- [ ] Super admin can access all airports/sessions
- [ ] Regular user can upload to assigned airport only
- [ ] Regular user sees only their airport's sessions
- [ ] Regular user cannot access other airport's sessions
- [ ] 403 Forbidden returned for unauthorized access
- [ ] 404 Not Found returned for non-existent resources

## Notes
- Super admins (`is_superuser=True`) bypass all airport-level restrictions
- Airport assignments managed via `/users/{user_id}/assign-airport/` endpoint
- User's airports loaded eagerly with `selectinload(User.airports)` in `get_current_user`
