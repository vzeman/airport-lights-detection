The system features advanced flight path planning that automatically generates optimal drone trajectories based on the specific measurement requirements of each assigned object.

#### Intelligent Flight Path Planning

The core innovation of the task management system is its ability to automatically generate complex flight paths that satisfy the unique measurement requirements of multiple objects within a single mission:

  - Input: Multiple objects with individual distance, angle, and pattern requirements
  - Processing: Advanced algorithms (genetic algorithms, simulated annealing, particle swarm optimization) 
  - Output: Single optimized flight path satisfying all measurement constraints
  
- **Geometric Path Planning**: Sophisticated 3D path generation considering:
  - **Distance Circles**: Each object defines measurement distance requirements creating virtual boundaries
  - **Angle Cones**: Required viewing angles create geometric constraints for drone positioning
  - **Pattern Integration**: Complex flight patterns (figure-8, spirals, grids) are merged into continuous paths
  - **Temporal Synchronization**: Timing requirements for sequential measurements and coordinated multi-drone operations

**Example Multi-Object Scenario:**
When a task includes multiple inspection types such as PAPI lights (requiring 300m-1500m distance measurements with approach patterns), runway edge lights (requiring 50m-100m parallel flights), and paint quality monitoring (requiring 15-25m grid patterns), the system:
1. **Analyzes Requirements**: Maps all distance and angle constraints for all object types including paint marking coverage areas
2. **Identifies Conflicts**: Detects overlapping flight paths and conflicting measurement requirements across different inspection types
3. **Optimizes Path**: Creates a unified flight plan that captures:
   - PAPI measurements during approach phases at higher altitudes
   - Edge light measurements during intermediate-altitude parallel flights

4. **Validates Safety**: Ensures the combined path maintains safe distances and adheres to aviation regulations across all altitude levels
5. **Estimates Resources**: Calculates total flight time, battery consumption, and data storage requirements for multi-spectrum analysis

**Paint-Specific Path Integration:**
When paint quality monitoring is combined with other tasks, the system intelligently sequences operations:
- **High-to-Low Altitude Progression**: Starts with distant measurements (PAPI, radio nav) and progressively moves to closer inspections
- **Grid Overlay Optimization**: Paint grid patterns are optimized to also capture other surface elements like cracks and lighting infrastructure
- **Lighting Condition Coordination**: Paint contrast measurements are scheduled for optimal lighting conditions that also benefit other inspection types

**Path Optimization Benefits:**
- **Efficiency**: Up to 60% reduction in flight time compared to sequential single-object missions
